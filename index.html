  <p>Hi babe, it's Joseph. Do you know that you are the best thing that has ever happened to Joseph? It's such a blessing meeting you, Atinukemi, as you like me calling you that name. Babe, I just want to take this moment to let you know how much you mean to me. You've been a blessing to my life, little did I know that you're the damsel that my destiny has been longing for. You brought joy into my life, you gave me hope when I desperately needed one, you encouraged when it was needed. Meeting you is divine. Thank you for agreeing to mother my children. This web is designed for you babe. You know I love you right?

<p><em>My babe's best meal is amala with efo riro. She is a typical Yoruba girl and I love her that way. She happens to be the first born of her parents with one younger sister and brother, Bukunmi and Lekan(Lekan lokoso as I fondly call him). Atinkemi's got a beautiful mum. Her mum acts just like my mum in words and in deeds. Atinkemi's got a very beautiful aunty also, she is so cute and her daughter, of course what do we expect.</em></p>
